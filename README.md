### **Goals** 
Create a sign up form for customers to register their details. 

    - Use github to create repo & clone to local machine.
    - Page contains a large background image, with logo overlaid on semi-transparent element. 
    - Use colour from background in button element.
    - Use 'error' class for form validation.
    - Change styling on 'selected' for inputs.
    - Add some styling for different desktop sizes.

### **Positives**
The HTML & CSS for the layout came very quickly & easily for me. Used absolute & relative positioning with z-index. 

### **Challenges:**
Trying to do as much validation with pure CSS as possible was trickier than I thought. Cant use ::after with input. Had to add another span for validation field and will incorporate icons within the span when I connect the JS. 

 

### **To Look Into:**
- Form validation with JS
- How to make sure valid and invalid fields are validated after user enters details, not before. 
- How to get dummy data to return so I can test if the form is working.
